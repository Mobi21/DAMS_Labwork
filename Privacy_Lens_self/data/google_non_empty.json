            "description":"If your looking for a smartwatch for less than $50 the Blackview ID205L  is one of the cheapest square smartwatches on the market. At such a bargain price, you\u2019re probably wondering if it actually does what it claims and whether it\u2019s worth investing in.\r\nWith this in mind, I purchased one to put it through its paces and I\u2019m sharing my honest findings in this review.\r\nOverall Verdict \r\nThe Blackview smartwatch is a cheap and simple smartwatch. Starting with the positives, it\u2019s very comfortable to wear on your wrist. This is because it\u2019s slim and lightweight due to its plastic build.\r\nThe best part of the device is the activity tracking. It can keep an eye on your daily fitness goals such as steps, calories burned, and distance traveled. It can also mirror your phone notifications, however, beyond this it doesn\u2019t have a lot of other truly useful features.\r\nIf you want something a little smarter but still doesn\u2019t break the bank, the Amazfit Bip U is a great choice. It has more detailed sports tracking thanks to extra sensors and the inclusion of GPS for tracking your routes.\r\n\r\nBlackview is a Chinese electronics brand that sells smartphones, tablets, watches, and accessories in over 60 countries across the world.\r\nThe brand was first popularised by its rugged smartphone but has since expanded to sell a variety of electronics at budget prices, usually through Amazon.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s In The Box\r\n\r\nThe Blackview arrived in a basic white branded box. Inside were:\r\n\r\nThe watch.\r\nA clip-on magnetic charger.\r\nInstruction manual.\r\nThe charger only had a USB connection so you\u2019ll need to source a wall adaptor if you don\u2019t already have one.\r\n\r\nDesign & Build Quality \r\nStarting with the design of the watch, it\u2019s a square watch that looks very reminiscent of the Apple Watch from a distance. However, when you pick it up, you\u2019ll immediately notice that it\u2019s a lot lighter and made of plastic and you can tell it\u2019s a cheap device.\r\nBeing lightweight and with a silicon rubber band, the watch is comfortable to wear, even when working out. You can also wear it whilst swimming or in the shower thanks to an IP68 waterproof rating which can withstand up to 1.5m of submersion in water.\r\nThe screen is 1.3\u201d with a TFT touch screen display. The colors are vibrant and the resolution is well suited to the features of the watch. The display isn\u2019t always-on but does come on whenever you lift your wrist so you can still use it as a regular watch for telling the time.\r\nThere\u2019s a single button that acts as a back button or a home button when you hold it down. Given how simple the interface is and the fact that you cannot use the watch for messaging, one button seems adequate for navigation.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nThe main features of the watch are fitness tracking and notification mirroring. I\u2019ll come on to discuss both of these later in the article.\r\nAside from this, there are a few other utilities that came in useful from time to time such as the stopwatch and countdown timer. These are useful for simple tasks such as boiling an egg, however, you cannot set laps so you\u2019ll still be reaching for your smartphone.\r\nThe watch also has basic media controls with play\/pause\/skip for songs playing on your phone. There\u2019s no built-in music storage or third-party streaming apps so you cannot play music directly on the watch.\r\nUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t get the alarm function to work on the Blackview and since it doesn\u2019t mirror the alarm from your phone, I had no way of using the watch for a morning wake-up call.\r\nWith such few features, the user interface was simple to navigate and I could reach most screens within a few taps.",

With the new LEDVANCE SMART+ app, that\u2019s no problem at all! \r\nThe new app has the advantage of combining all previous functions in a single application. Of course, we understand that switching to a new app can be annoying, but we promise: handling your smart lights is even easier with LEDVANCE SMART+ from now!\r\nTo show you what to expect, we have summarized the smart features for you below:\r\nFlexible lighting\r\nA flexible lighting mode allows you to adjust brightness, color temperature or even the colors of your smart lights according to your respective needs. You can set different moods thanks to pre-installed light scenes but an individual modification is also possible.\r\nSchedules & Automations\r\nWith the help of the new LEDVANCE SMART+ app, you can set up different schedules and automations: You are watching TV at the same time every day and want to switch off the ceiling light to do so? No problem! Once set, your smart devices will automatically repeat this action every day by themselves.\r\nSmart lighting for your daily routine & circadian rhythm\r\nWhether waking up in the morning or going to bed in the evening \u2013 with some of the LEDVANCE products you can easily define a sunrise alarm with fade-in or fade-out lighting via app. Also super helpful: Light similar to natural daylight can help improve physical well-being. Based on this scientific finding, you can adjust the light color and brightness of certain luminaires to your individual daily routine - for calmer sleep and a better mood.\r\nAdaptation to light conditions\r\nIf the sun is shining, you usually need little to no additional light. If it is cloudy, on the other hand, artificial light is needed to brighten up the room. By linking to weather information, your lighting independently adjusts to the current natural lighting conditions.\r\nIntegration with other smart home systems\r\nDo you already use Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, Home Connect Plus or Amazon Alexa? The combination of the LEDVANCE SMART+ app with these systems offers you additional features for many end devices - for example, voice control. The app even supports 28 languages here.\r\nGrouping lamps\r\nWith the new LEDVANCE app, it is possible to organize several lamps into groups and control them simultaneously. For example, you can set all your outdoor lights to turn on together.\r\nPower consumption \r\nIf you use WiFi sockets for your smart lighting or other devices, you can view the energy consumption at any time with the help of our app \u2013 that's good for the environment and your wallet!\r\nSolar lights control\r\nSolar lights usually turn on by themselves. However, our smart solar products can also be conveniently controlled using the new SMART+ app.\r\nCamera and sensor control\r\nDo you use smart outdoor lights with integrated cameras or sensors? Thanks to the LEDVANCE SMART+ app, you'll receive live images and notifications when your lights detect movement.\r\nIntegration of non-smart devices into the system\r\nYou want to control a non-smart light via our app? Thanks to the SMART+ Plug, even conventional lights and devices can be integrated into your smart home system and controlled via the LEDVANCE SMART+ app.\r\nNote: Please note that some functions of the app only work with WiFi or Bluetooth devices. Zigbee devices are not compatible with this app.\r\nAs you can see, the new LEDVANCE SMART+ app offers many functions around smart lighting and beyond. The future belongs to smart home systems. LEDVANCE therefore offers you a wide range of smart lighting solutions for indoors and outdoors to pair with the app. These solutions are not only extremely efficient, but also visually appealing .

            "description":"The Umidigi Uwatch 3S is the direct successor to the Uwatch 2S which was released a bit earlier this year and, in a sense, it\u2019s a corrected version of the previous smartwatch since it now has a proper Sp02 sensor (for measuring the Oxygen level in blood), while the Uwatch 2S got this functionality removed from the software \u2013 I assume because the hardware couldn\u2019t really support it.\r\n\r\nEverything else seems to be identical, so you get the same circular design, the same color display, the software and the functions are also identical, minus the Sp02 measurement, of course.\r\nI know that the smartwatch had a rough start due to the limited features and especially due to the bad battery life (unless you went with Pebble), but after Apple made it trendy, everyone wanted one, so it\u2019s interesting to see that Umidigi promises such a compelling package at a very affordable price tag.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Uwatch 3S seems to offer up to 15 days of battery life while its smart functions are active, there\u2019s also the 24\/7 heart rate monitoring, the aforementioned Blood Oxygen monitoring, multiple sport modes, but it does not rely on Android Wear. Some would see it as an advantage, but we\u2019ll just have to see if Umidigi has managed to build a balanced device and whether the high price of some other smartwatches is completely unjustified.\r\n\r\nDesign and Build Quality\r\nUmidigi is mainly known for its budget-friendly smartphones and smartwatches, and, while the plan to undercut every competitor has worked really well in its favor for a while now, surely it had to make some compromises at least in the design department, right? It will obviously not feel the same as an Apple Watch or a Galaxy Watch, but it can definitely hold its ground against devices that cost at least double the price. Indeed, the circular frame of the Uwatch 3S is made of aluminum alloy (aircraft-grade!) which ensures that the smartwatch weighs very little \u2013 pair that with the plastic rear side and you get a device that weighs only 0.88 ounces, without the straps. Not that the silicone straps add that much weight even though they\u2019re fairly large (very similar to the straps that I got with the TicWatch Pro 2020 \u2013 well, minus the leather top). The front is made of glass and I am not entirely sure whether they used Gorilla Glass (the manufacturer hasn\u2019t disclosed it), but the screen didn\u2019t get scratched even though I bumped it into various objects (unintentionally).\r\n\r\nSince it\u2019s still glass (2.5D tempered glass with anti-fingerprint coating) and considering that there is no protective lip, which is the standard with the rugged smartwatches, I would be a bit more careful and avoid hitting the screen especially on sharper surfaces (or dropping it). It may not be that shock-proof (well, most smartwatches aren\u2019t), but it does seem to fare quite well with water activities. That\u2019s right, Umidigi says that the smartwatch is waterproof, so it can be submerged down to 164 feet (or 50 meters) due to its 5ATM rating. It still won\u2019t work for scuba diving, water dives, dynamic watersports or hot water showers (apparently), but it should work just fine while swimming or snorkeling (raining or snowing on the smartwatch will also do no damage). One oddity that I immediately noticed after taking the smartwatch out of its package is that there were no buttons anywhere on the case. So how do you exactly operate the Uwatch 3S?\r\n\r\nYou need to tap the screen to wake it if the smartwatch is not strapped to your wrist or simply rotate to wake if it\u2019s on your wrist. I have noticed that the tap to wake would not always work and I had to insist with two or three taps to activate the display, but while on the wrist, the rotate to wake function worked flawlessly. Another quirk that I saw was when I left the smartwatch on the desk near my keyboard was that my \u2018violent writing\u2019 would sometimes activate the screen \u2013 so yes, vibrations seems to sometimes turn on the display.",
